              <p class="editable"><strong>April 2023:</strong> Enrolled in the University of Aizu, a public university in Fukushima Prefecture known for its focus on computer science and engineering. Withdrew after six months.</p>
              <p class="editable"><strong>Reason for withdrawal: ChatGPT and student loans.</strong></p>
              <p class="editable">Around the same time I started university, ChatGPT-4 was released. It was truly shocking. When I weighed "the evolution of AI over the next four years" against "what I would learn at university," I deeply questioned whether it was worth continuing my studies while carrying a student loan.</p>
              <p class="editable">After much deliberation, I made the decision on my own to leave the university after just half a year.</p>
              <p class="editable"><strong>October 2024 – Present:</strong> Currently studying as a first-year student at <strong>Jiyugaoka SANNO University</strong>, a well-regarded distance learning institution in Japan.</p>
              <p class="editable">I decided to return to university after gaining some financial stability, feeling confident I could complete my degree without needing student loans.</p>
              <p class="editable">While academic achievement isn't my main focus, I believe that <strong>having a degree can help open up more opportunities in the future</strong>.</p>
              <p class="editable">At the same time, I'm also focused on building practical skills through work and self-study.</p>
              <p class="editable">The university's flexible curriculum allows students to concentrate their studies on weekends, so <strong>my full-time job remains completely unaffected</strong>.</p>
              <p class="editable">I'm continuing my studies at a steady, manageable pace.</p>

        <summary>Why Full-Remote Work Is a Must for Me</summary>
        <div class="details-content">
          <p>I can do my best work in a quiet and calm environment, which allows me to give the most to my team.</p>
          <h4>My Personality and Traits</h4>
          <p>I am an introvert with HSP traits, making me sensitive to noise and movement. Busy offices are draining and prevent me from using my full potential. In a quiet space, I can focus, learn effectively, and achieve good results, like when I studied for my AWS certification.</p>
          <h4>Staying in a good mood helps me do my best work</h4>
          <p>A calm state of mind provides the energy for sustained effort, which brings value to the team. A quiet environment helps me stay mentally balanced and focused.</p>
           <h4>Where I want to work remotely</h4>
          <p>I plan to live alone in my hometown of Nagoya. I concentrate better when I have my own quiet space, separate from my parents. This lifestyle, balanced with occasional social time, is ideal for long-term high performance.</p>
           <h4>It's not that I'm bad at building relationships</h4>
          <p>I enjoy teamwork but my sensitive nature means I can get tired even in a good office environment. Choosing a quiet setting is a conscious decision based on self-awareness to maximize my contribution.</p>
          <h4>My Experience Working Remotely with Others</h4>
          <p>As a Bridge SE, I already work closely with full-remote Filipino engineers. We use calls and screen sharing to maintain clear communication and have built strong trust and steady output. This experience convinces me that full-remote work is where I can best apply my strengths.</p>

        <summary>Why I Want to Build My Career as an Engineer</summary>
        <div class="details-content">
          <p>I want to create things that bring joy and inspiration to others. I feel a growing desire to move from managing engineers to being a developer who creates value through code. Learning, especially about new technologies like AI, is my greatest source of entertainment. Seeing clients thank our engineers inspires me to one day be the one who builds the solutions that help people.</p>

        <summary>My Thoughts on Employment Style</summary>
        <div class="details-content">
          <p>I prefer to start with a paid internship (3-6 months) to ensure a good fit for both myself and the company. This allows me to gain experience and adapt to the team without the pressure of a full-time role from day one. I am committed to contributing beyond expectations and would be grateful for consideration for a full-time position if we build mutual trust.</p>

        <summary>Ideal Company Culture</summary>
        <div class="details-content">
          <p><strong>I am a good fit for companies that quickly adopt and actively use new technologies and services.</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>A culture that actively uses AI tools (e.g., Google AI Studio, Cursor, ClaudeCode, MCP server).</li>
            <li>A company that officially promotes and encourages AI usage, ideally with financial support for tools.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Conversely, I may not be a good fit for companies that do not place much importance on adopting new technologies.</p>

            <p class="editable">I plan to start approximately <strong>three months after a final offer</strong>. I am committed to a smooth transition out of my current role, including preparing thorough handover documents. It is important to me to act with integrity and not leave my current team in a difficult position. I would also use this time to study and prepare for the new role.</p>
